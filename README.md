Image data set for alphabets in the American Sign Language

The training data set contains 87,000 images which are 200x200 pixels.

There are 29 classes, of which 26 are for the letters A-Z and 3 classes for SPACE, DELETE and NOTHING.

These 3 classes are very helpful in real-time applications, and classification.

The test data set contains a mere 29 images, to encourage the use of real-world test images.
